# Final Simplification - Single Trainer Class

## What Changed

The trainer has been further simplified by removing the inheritance hierarchy and putting everything into a single `Trainer` class.

### Before (with inheritance)
```python
class Trainer(ABC):
    # Abstract base class
    @abstractmethod
    def compute_loss(self, batch):
        pass
    
    def train_step(self, batch):
        # ...training logic

class DistillTrainer(Trainer):
    # Concrete implementation
    def compute_loss(self, batch):
        # ...distillation loss
```

### After (single class)
```python
class Trainer:
    """Trainer for teacher-student distillation."""
    
    def __init__(self, student_model, teacher_model, optimizer, lr_scheduler, checkpointer=None):
        self.student_model = student_model
        self.teacher_model = teacher_model
        # ...
    
    def compute_loss(self, batch):
        # Distillation loss implementation
        # ...
    
    def train_step(self, batch):
        # Training logic
        # ...
```

## Why This Is Better

1. **Simpler**: No abstract base class, no inheritance
2. **More Direct**: Loss computation is right in the same class
3. **Easier to Read**: Everything in one place
4. **Still Maintains All Features**:
   - ✅ Gradient accumulation
   - ✅ FSDP sync control
   - ✅ Early stopping
   - ✅ Checkpointing
   - ✅ Hybrid distillation loss (CE + KL)
   - ✅ Distributed training

## Usage

Exactly the same as before:

```python
from simple_trainer import Trainer

trainer = Trainer(
    student_model=student_model,
    teacher_model=teacher_model,
    optimizer=optimizer,
    lr_scheduler=lr_scheduler,
    checkpointer=checkpointer,
)

# Training loop
for batch in train_loader:
    loss = trainer.train_step(batch)
```

- Sum reduction for proper gradient accumulation

### Training Features
- Gradient accumulation with FSDP sync control
- Gradient clipping
- Learning rate scheduling
- Distributed loss gathering
- Periodic memory cleanup

### Evaluation
- Full evaluation pass
- Distributed gathering of metrics
- Early stopping logic

## When to Use This vs Original

**Use Simple Version (`src_simple/`) when:**
- Single teacher-student distillation
- Standard full logits (not sparse)
- Don't need ensemble
- Want clean, readable code
- Don't need complex callbacks/logging

**Use Original Version (`src/`) when:**
- Multi-round training
- Ensemble distillation
- Sparse logprobs (memory efficient)
- Complex logging requirements
- ID tracking per sample

## Bottom Line

The simplified trainer has **everything you need** for robust teacher-student distillation:
- ✅ Production-ready training logic
- ✅ FSDP/distributed compatible
- ✅ Proper gradient accumulation
- ✅ Early stopping
- ✅ Checkpointing
